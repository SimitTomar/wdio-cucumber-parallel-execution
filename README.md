# wdio-cucumber-parallel-execution

A WebdriverIO capability for running **Cucumber** scenarios within **Single/Multiple** Feature Files in parallel.

The capability Segregates the entire Automation Suite into smallest independent chunks (Scenarios) and spawns numerous threads through WebdriverIOs maxInstances feature,thus reducing the Test Execution time drastically and allowing Teams to release much faster.

The Solution is Compatible with multiple versions of Nodejs (Ones supporting Async Await natively as well as ones which do not support it)

Handles merging of reports out of the box and provides a consolidated JSON Report Array, which can be leveraged for Reporting.

**Star the repo if you find it useful :)**


# Installation

```
npm install wdio-cucumber-parallel-execution --save-dev
```

# Architectural View

![ParallelExecution](parallelExecution.png)

Assuming 1 Scenario takes 1 minute on Average, Total Execution Time will be 1 minute for 9 Scenarios since  all 9 Scenarios will get executed in parallel

# API


The Module contains the following functions:



### performSetup

This Feature Creates/Removes the Spec and Temp Folders and puts every Scenario in a seperate Feature File


| Parameter                        | Type   | Details                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### getConsolidatedArray


This Feature clubs the JSON Objects generated by every splitted Feature File and returns a consolidated JSON Array, which can be used for Reporting.

|----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| parallelExecutionReportDirectory | string | Path to Parallel Execution Report Directory where all the Reports will be saved |




# Usage

### Setup

Say, in your webdriverio's config file, put the following code:

wdio.conf.js

```
const argv = require("yargs").argv;
const wdioParallel = require('wdio-cucumber-parallel-execution');
// The below module is used for cucumber html report generation
const reporter = require('cucumber-html-reporter');
const currentTime = new Date().toJSON().replace(/:/g, "-");

const sourceSpecDirectory = `path/to/featureFilesDirectory`;
const parallelExecutionReportDirectory = `path/to/parallelExecutionReportDirectory`;

...

exports.config = {
    // Runner Configuration

    ...

    specs: [sourceSpecDirectory],

    ...

    /**
    * Gets executed once before all workers get launched.
    * @param {Object} config wdio configuration object
    * @param {Array.<Object>} capabilities list of capabilities details
    */
    onPrepare: (config, capabilities) => {
        // If parallel execution is set to true, then create the Split the feature files
        // And store then in a tmp spec directory (created inside `the source spec directory)
        tmpSpecDirectory = `${sourceSpecDirectory}/tmp`;
            if (argv.parallel === 'true') {
                wdioParallel.performSetup({
                    sourceSpecDirectory: sorceSpecDirectory,
                    tmpSpecDirectory: tmpSpecDirectory,
                    cleanTmpSpecDirectory: true
                });
                config.specs = `${tmpSpecDirectory}/**`;
            } else {
                fsExtra.removeSync(tmpSpecDirectory);
            }

    ...

    }
```

### Get Consolidated JSON Report Array

wdio.conf.js

```
exports.config = {
    // Runner Configuration

    /**
     * Gets executed once before all workers get launched.
     * @param {Object} config wdio configuration object
     * @param {Array.<Object>} capabilities list of capabilities details
     */
    onPrepare: () => {

        ...

        // Remove the `tmp/` folder that holds the json report files
        removeSync(parallelExecutionReportDirectory);
        
        ...

    },

    /**
     * Gets executed after all workers got shut down and the process is about to exit. An error
     * thrown in the onComplete hook will result in the test run failing.
     * @param {Object} exitCode 0 - success, 1 - fail
     * @param {Object} config wdio configuration object
     * @param {Array.<Object>} capabilities list of capabilities details
     * @param {<Object>} results object containing test results
     */
    onComplete: () => {

        try{
            let consolidatedJsonArray = wdioParallel.getConsolidatedData({
                parallelExecutionReportDirectory: parallelExecutionReportDirectory
            });

            let jsonFile = `${parallelExecutionReportDirectory}report.json`;
            fs.writeFileSync(jsonFile, JSON.stringify(consolidatedJsonArray));
    
            // The below code is not part of wdio-cucumber-parallel-execution module
            // but is mentioned to show, how it can be used with other reporting modules
            var options = {
                theme: 'bootstrap',
                jsonFile: jsonFile,
                output: `tests/reports/html/report-${currentTime}.html`,
                reportSuiteAsScenarios: true,
                scenarioTimestamp: true,
                launchReport: true,
                ignoreBadJsonFile: true
            };
    
            reporter.generate(options);
        } catch(err){
            console.log('err', err);
        }
    }
}

```

### Pass parallel execution Flag as true

package.json
```
  "scripts": {
    "test": "command to run your tests with --parallel=true"
  }

```
